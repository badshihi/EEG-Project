# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Project

(Final Project Grade: 100/100)

This repository contains the code and dataset for training an RNN to classify EEG readings into one of four motor imagery classes. CNN and C-RNN implementations achieve goal accuracies. The other architectures are experimental and therefore still need some work...
